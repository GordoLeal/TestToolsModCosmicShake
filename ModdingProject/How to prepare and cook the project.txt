- Unreal Editor:
You need to download the same unreal editor version used by the developers to compile the game, for cosmic shake is unreal editor 4.27.2;
You can check it by going into the game .exe, right clicking, "properties", on the "details" tab you should see something like UE4+Release+**unrealVersion** etc...

- Preparing the UnrealPak
Inside the folder you downloaded, there should be a .bat called unrealpak-with-compression. Copy it.
Go where your unreal engine is installed and find the folder "\Engine\Binaries\Win64"
UnrealPak.exe should be there.
paste the .bat there, and copy the .bat you just placed, so we can make a shortcut for it later.
Go back to the folder you downloaded and right click -> create shortcut. it should create a shortcut for the .bat.
this is the file we gonna use for paking the project.

- TestToolsMod project.
Test Tools Mod is a speedrun practice and glitch hunting assistant i made for Spongebob:cosmic shake community.
i am providing the unreal project so you can have something to play or maybe learn something.
obs: I have low learning of Unreal, so the project don't have the best blueprint programing practices, but it may give you
knowledge to understand how to do something small like inserting your own blueprint actor into the game.

- How to cook the project
Top-Left > File > Cook content for windows.
After is done, go into the project file > Saved > WindowsNoEditor > TestToolsMod
Copy the Content Folder.
Inside the folder you downloaded there is a folder called "TestToolsMod_P".
Paste the content folder inside the "CosmicShake" folder.
Your folder structure should now be "TestToolsMod_P\CosmicShake\Content\..."
Now the mod folder is done, if you are only changing models/sounds/textures... this should be enough and you can just pak it.
but test tools mod are overwriting blueprints to run their own and for this we need to do some extra steps.
inside the folder you downloaded there is a folder called HexEditedFiles, open it and copy the files.
Now go to "TestToolsMod_P\CosmicShake\Content\CS\Core\Game" and paste it, overwriting a few files.
now we can pak the mod for it to work with the game.

- Paking the project.
recap: if you did everthing right with "Preparing UnrealPak" step you should have the folder "TestToolsMod_P" and the "unrealpak-with-compression" shortcut pointing to the .bat file that is inside the UE_4.27\...\Win64 folder.
Now just holde left click and Move the TestToolsMod_P folder into the .bat file and it should start the paking process.
if you did everthing right, a .pak file will be created and you can rename it to anything like BigAssAndBalls_P.pak
BUT REMEMBER: "_P.pak" at the end is necessary so the engine can detect it as a patch, idk how exactly it works but is necessary.

-Installing the mod
Go into the game folder, find the "content" folder and create a ~Mods folder, place the .pak file inside.
for cosmic shake is: "\CosmicShake\Content\Paks"
start the game and have fun with your mod.


-Tips:
If you are changing models,sounds and/or textures make sure to follow the same path that the game uses.
example: you want to change a texture that is inside "CosmicShake\Content\audio\burp", the folder path in the unreal project needs to be "Content\audio\burp" and after the cooking you add the CosmicShake folder.
You can use FModel (https://fmodel.app/) to check\extract the game files and the path structure.
